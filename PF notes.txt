Parcelforce.net
--------

Enter login details and submit to login to dashboard

Find 'enter a shipment' by href

Product needs choosing on every load -> Constant loading could upset Parcelforce system -> Run Parcelforce as a thread?

Input "E"+UN in address book

Need to test if label still pops up on headless mode or not -> if not, how does object handle this?

If address doesn't show up, wait x time then re-enter address code just in case error occurred.

Input address may cause address verification tab to open -> Again if it appears in headless this is fine. Otherwise, issue. Need to have a wait function to see if verification tab opens. Once verification closes, need to re-type business name before processing.

May get logged out due to inactivity, but this only occurs after trying to enter address code. If address code is entered, check to see if back on login screen.

Always make user select number of return parcels (possibly from dropdown list).

Compare postcode and town as two separate comparisons.
