If no file exists, create one and brute-force every AA number on Parcelforce AND gateway.
Use fuzzy or jellyfish, if there is discrepancy, note it somewhere.
Once brute-force is done. Prompt to clean the discrepant numbers and push updates to PF address book.

Once a day/week, run the script again. Instead of new file, use the previous file and do a quick compare of gateway and the stored AA address.
Again, use fuzzy/jellyfish, note discrepancies, clean them.
Store results in csv.
Store backups.

Needs - Access to gateway, access to parcel force, List of AA numbers in use would be very useful.

Gateway postcode may be written correctly (with space) or contain no spaces. 
Postcodes are either *** *** or **** *** so just hard code that. Parcelforce won't take it without the space.
