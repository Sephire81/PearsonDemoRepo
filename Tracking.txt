Tracking
--------
Do tracking in incognito - Server returns 429 after too many requests, incognito bypasses error 429 (Error can still occur after more usage)
Give tracking id to program.
Enter number -> tracking box - id = "edit-parcel-tracking-number", track button - input - id="edit-submit"
go to tbody, get top element of tbody then look at td[class="tracking-history-desc"]/p.first
Handle exception of tracking being wrong.
Upload "User \t tracking_id \t status" to clipboard. If status is "Delivered" also append "\t date" with date in format dd/mm/yyyy
